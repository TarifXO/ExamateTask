# Jetpack Compose Tutorial Application with Tooltip Simulation

This is an Android application built using Jetpack Compose, focusing on implementing a step-by-step tooltip tutorial overlay. The application simulates a basic navigation setup with five tabs, each leading to different dummy content screens, while guiding users through an interactive tutorial.

## Overview

This project is designed to:
- Showcase Jetpack Compose's capabilities in structuring multi-tab navigation.
- Emulate the tooltip and overlay tutorial behavior.
- Highlight specific UI elements and guide users on their initial app interaction.

## Features

-Jetpack Compose: used it for the ui of this app as required.

## Screens

This app has five main screens as per the Figma reference:
1. **Home**
2. **Connect**
3. **Questions**
4. **Tools**

Each screen displays unique dummy content, focusing on layout accuracy.
